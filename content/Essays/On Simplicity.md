# On Simplicity

Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

[[index|Essays]] | [[On Learning]]

## The Art of Less

In a world of constant noise and complexity, choosing simplicity is an act of rebellion. It requires saying no to good ideas to make room for great ones.

## Principles

- **Remove the unnecessary**: What can be eliminated without loss?
- **Clarify the essential**: What truly matters?
- **Embrace constraints**: Limits breed creativity

## In Practice

Simplicity applies to code, writing, design, and life itself. The challenge is not in adding more, but in having the courage to subtract.
