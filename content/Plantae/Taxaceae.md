# Taxaceae

**English:** Yew family  
**Dutch:** Taxusfamilie

The Taxaceae is a small family of conifers comprising about 6 genera and 30 species. Unlike most conifers, they produce fleshy, berry-like structures (arils) instead of woody cones. Many species contain toxic alkaloids, particularly taxine.

## Key Identifying Features

- **Leaves:** Linear, flat needles arranged spirally or in two ranks
- **Seeds:** Surrounded by a fleshy, often brightly colored aril
- **Bark:** Reddish-brown, thin and scaly
- **No true cones:** Seeds are solitary, not in cone structures

## Genera

- [[Taxus]] - Yews
- [[Cephalotaxus]] - Plum yews
