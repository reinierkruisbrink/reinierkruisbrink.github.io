# Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior

## Overview

Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior by Thomas Parr, Giovanni Pezzulo, and Karl Friston offers a comprehensive and mathematical look at Karl Friston's theoretical framework for understanding cognition and behavior.

## Key Concepts
### Free Energy and Predictive Processing

- **Free Energy Principle**: The brain minimizes a quantity akin to prediction error (free energy) to maintain internal stability and reduce surprise.
  - **Implication**: Perception and action are unified: perception updates beliefs; action changes the world to match predictions.

### Cognition as Inference

- **Perception, Attention, and Memory**: These cognitive functions are cast as processes that optimize predictions and reduce uncertainty.
  - **Attention**: Allocated to sensory channels or cues that most reduce uncertainty.

### Computational Models & Applications

- **Active Inference Models**: Formal frameworks that illustrate how agents can plan, learn, and act by minimizing expected free energy.
  - **Applications**: Explaining behavior, clinical phenomena, and inspiration for adaptive robotics and AI.

The book emphasizes a unifying, mathematical view of cognition where organisms continuously infer and act to minimize costly surprises.
