# The Aeneid

## Overview

The Aeneid by Virgil is an epic poem that follows Aeneas, a Trojan warrior, after the fall of Troy. Heavily inspired by the Oddyssey by Homer, this Roman version of Greece art is slightly altered in such a way to account for Rome's glory.

## Key Concepts

Aeneas faces numerous obstacles on his journey, including storms sent by the vengeful goddess Juno (Jupiter's wife), battles with various mythical creatures, and the emotional turmoil of leaving his past behind.
                  Guided by destiny and the goddess Venus (his mother), Aeneas journeys to Italy to establish a new homeland for his people, eventually becoming the ancestor of the Romans.
                  The poem is considered an allegory for the founding of Rome, legitimizing Roman rule and its connection to the Trojan hero Aeneas, linking Rome to divine heritage.
                  The poem explores themes of destiny, duty, love, loss, and the importance of piety and respect for the gods. It's a rich tapestry of Roman mythology, history, and culture, blending the heroic with the divine.
