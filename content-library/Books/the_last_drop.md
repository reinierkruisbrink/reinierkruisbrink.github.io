# The Last Drop

## Overview

The Last Drop by Tim Smedley explores the global water crisis, arguing that the issue isn't a lack of water on Earth but rather how humans mismanage and distribute it.

## Key Concepts

Smedley explains that the world's water isn't disappearing, but its cycle is intensifying due to climate change. As the planet heats up, more water evaporates, increasing atmospheric water vapor, which is a greenhouse gas itself. This intensifies the water cycle, leading to more extreme weather events. Wet areas get wetter, and dry areas get drier, causing more frequent and intense storms, floods, and droughts. The book highlights that while these events are natural, human activity is increasing their intensity and frequency.

### Mismanagement of Water Resources

**Over-extraction** from aquifers and rivers exceeds the rate at which they can be replenished. Empty aquifers can collapse, leading to structural damage to the land above.

**Human Engineering** like dams, canals, and reservoirs disconnect rivers and lakes from their underground aquifers, disrupting natural water cycles and reducing the availability of groundwater. Even desalination can have significant environmental impacts, such as harming marine ecosystems and increasing greenhouse gas emissions due to high energy costs.

**Pollution** from sewage, agricultural runoff (manure and fertilizers), and pharmaceuticals creates ecological imbalances, such as algal blooms that harm biodiversity. Industrial waste from sources like old mines introduces heavy metals and other harmful substances such as micro- and nanoplastics into water systems.

### Solutions and Innovations

**Agriculture** the largest consumer of water, can adopt eco- and water friendly practices like no-till farming to improve soil health and water retention as well as implementing crop rotation and cover cropping.

**Tiered water pricing** can incentivize conservation by charging more for higher usage, encouraging more responsible water use.

**Rainwater harvesting** can be implemented to collect and store rainwater for irrigation and other uses, reducing reliance on groundwater and surface water sources. It is also effective for off-grid systems.

**Wastewater treatment ** can be improved to make treated wastewater safe for irrigation and industrial use, reducing the demand for freshwater.

**Nature-based solutions** are central to the book's argument. These include rewilding, restoring natural wetlands, and even reintroducing animals like beavers to create natural dams and water filtration systems. Or, removing water-greedy invasive species that disrupt the local water cycles.

                  Overall very interesting insights into water management, although it can be heavy and overdone in terms of statistics and policy. I think Tim Smedley captured the problem at its core in the introduction "The world isn't running out of water - people are."
