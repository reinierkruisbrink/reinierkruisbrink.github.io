# Everything Is Predictable: How Bayesian Statistics Explain Our World

## Overview

The book is not so much an engaging deep dive into how Bayesian probability works, but rather advocating for its power as a framework for understanding not just statistics, but human reasoning, psychology, and even the functioning of the brain.

## Key Concepts
### Bayesian Reasoning as a Framework

- **Bayes' Theorem**: Continuous updating of beliefs (priors) in light of evidence (likelihood) to form posteriors — a principled way to handle uncertainty.

### Core Concepts and Pitfalls

- **Subjective Probability**: Probability as degree of belief, not just long-run frequency.
- **Occam's Prior & Cromwell's Rule**: Favor simpler explanations but never assign zero prior to plausible hypotheses.
- **False Positive Risks**: Overreliance on p-values and neglect of priors inflates false discoveries.

### The Bayesian Brain and Cognition

- **Predictive Processing**: Perception as inference — the brain balances priors and sensory evidence to minimize prediction error.
- **Implications**: Biases, optical illusions, and certain psychiatric states can be framed as miscalibrated priors or likelihoods.

Chivers advocates Bayesian thinking as a unifying lens for statistics, cognition, and everyday reasoning, while noting practical limits and common misuses.
