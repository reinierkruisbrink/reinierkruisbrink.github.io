# Being You: A New Science of Consciousness

## Overview

In "Being You," neuroscientist Anil Seth takes you on a journey to understand the essence of consciousness and the self. He challenges traditional views and proposes a new theory based on the idea of our brains as predictive machines.

## Key Concepts

Here's a breakdown of Seth's central ideas:

 (1) The Predictive Brain: We don't passively perceive the world; our brains actively construct our reality based on past experiences and predictions. These predictions are constantly being refined based on sensory input, creating our unique conscious experience. So we do not perceive the world as it is, but as our brain predicts/expects it to be.
                      
 (2) The Controlled Hallucination: Seth argues that consciousness is a kind of controlled hallucination - an ongoing internal model of the world built by our brains to help us navigate and survive by anticipating rather than reacting.
                      
 (3) The Breakdown of You: The book explores what happens when this predictive process breaks down, like in illusions, dreams, or hallucinations. This sheds light on altered states of consciousness and even mental illness.

                  "Being You" is a thought-provoking exploration of what it means to be conscious and the ongoing quest to understand this fundamental aspect of human experience.
