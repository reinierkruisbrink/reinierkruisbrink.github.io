# Neuropedia: A Brief Compendium of Brain Phenomena

## Overview

"Neuropedia" serves as an informative and entertaining guide to the many wonders of the brain, providing readers with a deeper appreciation of the complexities and marvels of the human nervous system.

## Key Concepts

Chudler opens with a quote by Ramón y Cajal: 

*Mientras el cerebro sea un arcano, el universo, reflejo de su estructura, será un mistério también. 
- Ramón y Cajal *

 Here are some key takeaways from the book:

 (1) Neuroanatomy: The book touches on different brain regions and their functions, the spinal cord and the vertebra, as well as the 12 cranial nerves (my favourite is the vagus nerve). It also covers the anatomy of the eye, ear, and other sensory organs.
                  
 (2) Notable Neuroscientists: Several key figures in the field of neuroscience are highlighted, including Santiago Ramón y Cajal, who won the Nobel Prize for his work on the structure of the nervous system, and Rita Levi-Montalcini, who discovered nerve growth factor.
                  
 (3) Diseases and Disorders: The book discusses various neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis, as well as the the possible causes and treatments for these conditions.
                  
 (4) Numerous Neurons: Although the brain constitutes only 2% of the body's weight, it consumes 20% of the body's energy. The book explains the role of dendrites, axons, synapses, and neurotransmitters in transmitting information between neurons and glands or muscles.

                  Overall, the book provides an overview of many topics in neuroscience without going into too much detail, making it accessible to readers who are new to the field and peak the interest of those who are already familiar with it.
