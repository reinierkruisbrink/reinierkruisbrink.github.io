# Planta Sapiens: The New Science of Plant Intelligence

## Overview

"Planta Sapiens" explores the fascinating world of plants and challenges our understanding of intelligence, consciousness, and communication in the plant kingdom. Calvo argues that plants possess complex behaviors and abilities that rival those of animals, challenging the traditional view of plants as passive organisms.

## Key Concepts

Calvo delves into the intricate ways plants communicate with each other and with other organisms, such as through chemical signals and root networks.
                  The book discusses evidence suggesting that plants exhibit intelligence, problem-solving abilities, and even memory, challenging the notion of intelligence as solely an animal trait. While the theories are built on compelling theories, the empirical evidence is still lacking.
                  Calvo explores the sensory capacities of plants, including their ability to perceive and respond to environmental cues such as light, touch, and sound.
                  The author examines various plant behaviors, from the way they adapt to changing conditions to their strategies for survival and reproduction.
                  Finally, he posits this behaviour to be a form of predictive processing (see Being You by Anil Seth; Active Inference by Thomas Parr; The Hidden Spring by Mark Solms), a theory of brain function that suggests organisms generate models of the world to anticipate and respond to changes in their environment.
