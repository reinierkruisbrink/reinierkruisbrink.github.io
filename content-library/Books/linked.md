# Linked: How Everything Is Connected to Everything Else and What It Means for Business, Science, and Everyday Life

## Overview

Linked is a foundational work in network science by Albert-László Barabási, originally published in 2002. While the field has advanced significantly since its publication, making some of its discussions quite out of date, the book remains an interesting look into the history and early development of the internet and modern network theory.

## Key Concepts
### Network Perspective

- **Connections over Components**: Complex systems are best understood through patterns of interactions rather than isolated parts.

### Key Network Types

- **Random Networks**: Uniform link probabilities lead to narrow degree distributions (Poisson-like).
- **Small‑World Networks**: High clustering plus short path lengths, enabling local cohesion and global reach.
- **Scale‑Free Networks**: Power‑law degree distributions with hubs that dominate connectivity.

### Structural Principles and Consequences

- **Hubs & Vulnerability**: Highly connected nodes support function but can be single‑point failure risks.
- **Redundancy & Modularity**: These features enhance robustness and enable specialization within networks.

Barabási provides an accessible introduction to network thinking: typologies, dynamics, and implications for robustness and control.
