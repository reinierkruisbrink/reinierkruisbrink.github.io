# Planta Sapiens: The New Science of Plant Intelligence

> Plants possess complex behaviors and abilities that rival those of animals, challenging the traditional view of plants as passive organisms through the lens of predictive processing theory.

## Overview

"Planta Sapiens" explores the fascinating world of plants and challenges our understanding of intelligence, consciousness, and communication in the plant kingdom. Calvo argues that plants possess complex behaviors and abilities that rival those of animals, challenging the traditional view of plants as passive organisms. While the theories are built on compelling arguments, the empirical evidence is still lacking.

## Key Concepts

### Communication Networks

Calvo delves into the intricate ways plants communicate with each other and with other organisms, such as through chemical signals and root networks. These communication pathways allow plants to share information about threats, resources, and environmental conditions.

### Plant Intelligence and Problem-Solving

The book discusses evidence suggesting that plants exhibit intelligence, problem-solving abilities, and even memory, challenging the notion of intelligence as solely an animal trait. Plants demonstrate sophisticated decision-making processes in resource allocation, growth patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Sensory Capacities

Calvo explores the sensory capacities of plants, including their ability to perceive and respond to environmental cues such as light, touch, and sound. Plants possess various receptors and mechanisms that allow them to monitor and react to their surroundings in ways that parallel animal sensory systems.

### Adaptive Behaviors

The author examines various plant behaviors, from the way they adapt to changing conditions to their strategies for survival and reproduction. These behaviors demonstrate a level of sophistication that suggests more than simple mechanical responses to stimuli.

### Predictive Processing Framework

Calvo posits plant behavior to be a form of predictive processing, a theory of brain function that suggests organisms generate models of the world to anticipate and respond to changes in their environment. This theoretical framework connects plant behavior to broader theories of cognition and consciousness explored in works by Anil Seth (Being You), Thomas Parr (Active Inference), and Mark Solms (The Hidden Spring).

## Personal Reflection

The most compelling aspect of this book is how it reframes plant behavior through the lens of predictive processing, suggesting that intelligence and consciousness might exist on a spectrum far broader than we traditionally conceive. However, the speculative nature of some claims highlights the need for more rigorous empirical work to substantiate these fascinating theoretical proposals.
