# The Extended Selfish Gene

## Overview

The Extended Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins is a follow-up to his highly influential book, The Selfish Gene. Dawkins expands on his original view that genes, not individual organisms, are the fundamental unit of natural selection.

## Key Concepts

Dawkins argues that genes are "replicators" - their primary function is to make copies of themselves and pass them on to future generations.
                  Organisms (or vehicles), in this view, are simply "survival machines" built by genes to ensure their own propagation.
                  Altruistic behaviors, from a gene's perspective, are only beneficial if they ultimately increase the chances of that gene surviving and being replicated. 
                  He introduces the concept of memes - ideas or cultural traits that spread through imitation, similar to how genes replicate. This concept has been debated and expanded upon in the field of cultural evolution.
                  The "Extended" concept expands the scope of selection. Dawkins proposes that genes can exert their influence not just on individual organisms but also on their environment and the behavior of other organisms.
