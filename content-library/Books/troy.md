# Troy

## Overview

In Stephen Fry's witty and engaging book, "Troy," he takes you on a thrilling journey through the legendary Trojan War. Unlike other retellings that focus solely on the Iliad's timeframe, Fry offers a more comprehensive view.

## Key Concepts

Fry delves beyond the epic battles of the Iliad. He explores the events leading up to the war, including the abduction of Helen (considered the face that launched a thousand ships) and the complex web of alliances and grudges that fueled the conflict. The narrative also extends past the events of the Iliad, touching upon the aftermath and the fates of the remaining characters.
                  Fry doesn't shy away from the fantastical elements of the Trojan War. He portrays the Greek gods and goddesses as powerful and often meddling figures, influencing the course of the war and the destinies of the heroes involved.
                  While battles and legendary warriors like Achilles are central to the story, Fry also highlights the role of cunning, strategy, and even trickery in the conflict. Characters like Odysseus, known for his intelligence and resourcefulness, are brought to life with depth and humor.
                  Fry avoids portraying the Trojans or Greeks as purely heroic or villainous. He explores the motivations, flaws, and complexities of characters on both sides of the conflict.
