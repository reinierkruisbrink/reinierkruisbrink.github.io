# Entangled Life: How Fungi Make Our Worlds, Change Our Minds & Shape Our Futures

## Overview

Sheldrake argues that fungi are vastly underestimated. Often overlooked, they play a critical role in Earth's ecosystems, from decomposition and nutrient cycling to forming symbiotic relationships with plants (like the mycorrhizal network nicknamed the "Wood Wide Web").

## Key Concepts
### Fungi as Ecosystem Engineers

- **Decomposition & Nutrient Cycling**: Fungi break down complex organic matter and mobilize nutrients, driving soil formation and plant productivity.
- **Mycorrhizal Networks**: Symbiotic connections that trade nutrients and signals between plants, often called the "wood‑wide web."

### Human Uses and Biotechnologies

- **Bioremediation & Materials**: Mycoremediation and fungal-derived materials (e.g., packaging, composites) show sustainable applications.
- **Medicinal Potential**: Compounds from fungi are sources for pharmaceuticals and are being explored in mental-health contexts.

### Fungi and Mind/Perception

- **Psychedelics & Consciousness**: Discussion of psilocybin's effects and what fungal chemistry reveals about cognition.

Sheldrake combines natural history and experimental examples to reposition fungi as active, influential partners in ecosystems and human innovation.
