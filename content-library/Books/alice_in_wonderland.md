# Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking-Glass

## Overview

Lewis Carroll's famous works,  Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, are a fantastical journey following Alice down the rabbit hole into a world of nonsensicality and wordplay.

## Key Concepts
### Nonsense and Linguistic Play

- **Absurdity as Method**: Carroll uses wordplay, paradox, and illogical sequences to subvert conventional meaning and comedic effect.
  - **Function**: Language games expose assumptions and invite playful re-interpretation.

### Social Satire and Victorian Critique

- **Satire beneath the whimsy**: The books lampoon rigid social and educational norms of Victorian England.
  - **Characters as caricatures**: Figures like the Queen of Hearts and the Mad Hatter embody social and bureaucratic absurdities.

### Identity and Journey

- **Growing up and selfhood**: Alice's physical transformations and encounters dramatize questions of identity and agency.
  - **Through the Looking-Glass**: Chess motifs and mirrored logic probe alternative orders and moral puzzles.

Carroll's work blends linguistic ingenuity with philosophical questions about meaning, society, and the self.
