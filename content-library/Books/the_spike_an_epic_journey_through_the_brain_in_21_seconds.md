# The Spike: An Epic Journey Through the Brain in 2.1 Seconds

## Overview

The Spike: An Epic Journey Through the Brain in 2.1 Seconds by Mark Humphries takes a deep dive into the fundamental unit of communication in the brain: the electrical spike.

## Key Concepts

Humphries starts with the basics, explaining how neurons communicate with each other through electrical spikes. These spikes are the language of the brain, carrying information from one neuron to another. The book explores how these spikes are generated, how they are transmitted, and how they are decoded by the receiving neuron.
                  The book then delves into some problematic observations that do not correspond to simple input-output spike models. Examples are neuron's abilities to spike at rates that seem not sustainable, or the amount of silent or dark neurons that do not react to external stimuli, or how single or only few stimuli cross the action potential threshold.
                  He theorizes that these silent neurons maintain information in their spike trains and keep the trigger threshold low, ready to fire when needed when few stimuli are presented. This resolves the speed, ease, and continuity at which action potentials can be formed. He interestingly links this to predictive processing and the brain's ability to expect and anticipate future events.
                  The intricate dance between excitatory and inhibitory neurons is another key concept. While excitatory neurons fire to send signals, inhibitory neurons act as a brake, ensuring balanced processing and preventing runaway activity.
