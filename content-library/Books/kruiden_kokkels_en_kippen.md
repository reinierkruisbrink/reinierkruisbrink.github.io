# Kruiden, Kokkels, en Kippen

## Overview

In Kruiden, Kokkels en Kippen, Dutch scientist and author Louise Fresco explores the scientific journey through the lens of two historical figures.

## Key Concepts
### Case Studies in Scientific Practice

- **Georg Rumphius**: A 17th‑century naturalist whose meticulous observations of Southeast Asian flora and fauna survived personal tragedy and posthumously influenced natural history.
- **Christiaan Eijkman**: Work on poultry disease led to insights about vitamin deficiency and health, illustrating serendipity in discovery.

### Lessons about Science

- **Nonlinear Progress**: Scientific advances often arise from persistence, accidents, and long-term observation rather than tidy experiments.
- **Recognition and Context**: Attribution can be messy; theory and observation interplay in complex ways.

Fresco draws human stories to illuminate how scientific knowledge is produced, validated, and remembered.
