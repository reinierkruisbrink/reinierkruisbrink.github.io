# An Immense World: How Animal Senses Reveal the Hidden Realms Around Us

## Overview

In An Immense World, Ed Yong takes us on an absolutely fascinating and mind-bending journey to explore the world through the senses of various animals. Thick and information dense but written in a way that is easy to understand, this book is a must-read for anyone interested in the natural world and the creatures that inhabit it.

## Key Concepts
### Umwelt: The Animal's Sensory World

- **Umwelt concept**: Each species experiences a distinctive sensory world shaped by its receptors and ecology.
  - **Example**: Ultraviolet vision in birds, echolocation in bats, magnetoreception in turtles.

### Sensory Specializations and Ecology

- **Sensors and Strategies**: How sensory systems are adapted for navigation, foraging, and communication.
  - **Examples**: Star-navigation in beetles; pressure-sensitive hairs in marine mammals.

### Human Impacts on Sensory Worlds

- **Anthropogenic Threats**: Light and noise pollution, habitat change, and chemical pollution that degrade animal sensory environments.
  - **Conservation implications**: Protecting the sensory integrity of habitats is critical for species survival.

Yong invites readers to broaden their notion of perception and to recognize the many unseen worlds that co-exist with our own.
