# Life on the Edge: The Coming of Age of Quantum Biology

## Overview

The Coming of Age of Quantum Biology by Johnjoe McFadden and Jim Al-Khalili isn't about pushing yourself to the limit, but rather exploring the surprising role of quantum mechanics in biological processes.

## Key Concepts
### Quantum Effects in Biology

- **Superposition & Coherence**: Hypotheses that biological systems (e.g., photosynthetic complexes) exploit quantum coherence for efficient energy transfer.
- **Tunneling**: Potential role in enzymatic reactions and electron/proton transfer that affect reaction rates.

### Sensory and Navigational Hypotheses

- **Magnetoreception**: Proposed quantum mechanisms for avian navigation using spin-dependent reactions.
- **Olfaction**: Speculative models suggesting vibrational or quantum contributions to odor detection.

### Speculation Versus Evidence

- **Balance of Plausibility**: The authors survey provocative hypotheses while noting experimental challenges and the frontier nature of quantum-biology claims.

McFadden and Al‑Khalili map an emerging field, highlighting tantalizing examples while distinguishing robust findings from speculative proposals.
