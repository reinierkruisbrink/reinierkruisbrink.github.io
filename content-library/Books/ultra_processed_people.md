synopsis: "Chris van Tulleken's Ultra-Processed People explores the profound impact of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) on human health, society, and the food industry. He argues that UPFs—industrially formulated products high in additives, emulsifiers, and preservatives, and low in fibers and the natural food-matrix, —are not just unhealthy but are actively reshaping our biology, behavior, and culture. The book examines how these foods affect our bodies at a molecular level while also exposing the corporate forces driving their dominance in global diets."

# Ultra-Processed People: The Science Behind Food That Isn't Food

## Overview

Chris van Tulleken's Ultra-Processed People explores the profound impact of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) on human health, society, and the food industry. He argues that UPFs—industrially formulated products high in additives, emulsifiers, and preservatives, and low in fibers and the natural food-matrix, —are not just unhealthy but are actively reshaping our biology, behavior, and culture. The book examines how these foods affect our bodies at a molecular level while also exposing the corporate forces driving their dominance in global diets.

## Key Concepts

UPFs are hard to classify perfectly but the NOVA classification system is a good start. It divides foods into four groups based on their level of processing: unprocessed or minimally processed foods, processed culinary ingredients, processed foods, and ultra-processed foods. Here are some key takeaways from the book:

### You have not evolved to eat this

**Disrupts Satiety Signals** UPFs alter appetite regulation (due to texture, softness, or artificial sweeteners), making people eat more than they would with whole foods. Studies show people eating UPFs consume 500 extra calories per day on average.

**Harms the Microbiome** Many UPFs contain emulsifiers and preservatives that disrupt gut bacteria, reducing microbial diversity and contributing to digestive and immune-related disorders.

**Drives Obesity &amp; Diabetes** Countries with high UPF consumption show skyrocketing rates of obesity and Type 2 diabetes. These foods are digested more quickly, leading to blood sugar spikes followed by crashes that drive more hunger and cravings.

### Aggressive Marketing &amp; Targeting of Marginalized Communities

**Cheap and Ubiquitous** UPFs are often cheaper than whole foods, making them more accessible in food deserts where fresh produce is scarce. They take less time to prepare so are generally more accessible for people with less time or money.

**Addictive Formulation** These foods are engineered to maximize *bliss points/hyperpalatiblity* (ideal combinations of sugar, fat, and salt, or artifical flavouring and colouring) that drive repeat and excess consumption, which in turn drives profits.

**Marketing to Children &amp; Low-Income Groups** The food industry spends billions on advertising, disproportionately targeting children (think of colourful happy packaging with animals) and marginalized communities with misleading health claims (see the next points).

### Industry-Funded Research &amp; Misinformation

**Conflicts of Interest** Many studies claiming that UPFs are 'not harmful' are backed by food corporations via institutes, similar to how Big Tobacco funded research to obscure the dangers of smoking. This and  this.

**Shifting Blame to Individuals** The industry promotes the *personal responsibility* narrative, suggesting that obesity is caused by lack of willpower rather than systemic issues like food engineering and marketing. Fascinating and upcoming research on constrained daily energy expenditure seems to show that, while exercise is definitely healthy and recommended, it cannot in a healthy way cause weight loss, even though exercise is marketed as a solution to obesity (by, you guessed it, industry) to shift the blame towards individuals and not the food they're producing.

**Lobbying Against Regulation** Food corporations spend vast sums lobbying against policies that limit UPF consumption, such as sugar taxes or advertising bans. Institutes like the FDA cannot possibly combat this multibillion dollar industry on their own, and analyse all foods and substances. They have introduced the GRAS, *generally recognized as safe*, label that industry can themselves assign if they do not want to go through the hassle of clinical trials. 

                  Chris has written an incredible keystone book that has shaken public view on UPF and nutrition and captures the complexities and atrocities of the interplay between science, policy, and industry. Simply a must-read.
