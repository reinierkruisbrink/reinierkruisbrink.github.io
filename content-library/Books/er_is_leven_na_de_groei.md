# Er is leven na de groei

## Overview

"Er is leven na de groei" by Paul Schenderling argues for a post-growth society in The Netherlands, challenging the relentless pursuit of economic expansion as the sole measure of progress and well-being.

## Key Concepts
### Critique of Growth

- **Limits to Growth**: Continuous GDP-driven expansion strains finite biophysical systems and often fails to increase genuine well‑being.
  - **Social costs**: Inequality, environmental degradation, and resource depletion are masked by growth metrics.

### Mechanisms Perpetuating Consumption

- **Planned Obsolescence & Market Design**: Product lifecycles and business incentives drive wasteful turnover.
- **Jevons Paradox**: Efficiency gains can paradoxically increase total consumption without systemic demand-side change.

### Policy Alternatives and Outcomes

- **Post-Growth Instruments**: Consumption taxes, reduced labour taxation, circular-economy policies, and stronger public services to decouple welfare from throughput.
- **Expected Outcomes**: Greater social equity, ecological sustainability, and potential improvements in well‑being and community connectedness.

Schenderling advocates reorienting policy toward resilience, sufficiency, and the redistribution of resources rather than perpetual accumulation.
