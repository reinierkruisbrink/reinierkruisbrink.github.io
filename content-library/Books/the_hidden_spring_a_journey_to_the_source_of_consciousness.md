# The Hidden Spring: A Journey to the Source of Consciousness

## Overview

In The Hidden Spring, Mark Solms, a neuropsychologist, ventures on a quest to understand the origin of consciousness. In my opinion, this book is an extension/combination of the work of Damasio and Seth/Friston.

## Key Concepts

Solms challenges the traditional view that consciousness arises in the cerebral cortex, the seat of higher functions like thinking and language. He argues that consciousness has a more ancient origin, rooted in a much older part of the brain - the brainstem, a region shared even with fish.
                  The book goes against the grain by placing emotions at the core of consciousness. Solms proposes that it's our emotional responses to the world, processed in the brainstem, that give rise to subjective experiences. E.g. hydrocephalic children, who lack a well-developed cortex, can still exhibit signs of consciousness, reinforcing this view.
                  The Hidden Spring also emphasizes the importance of the body in shaping consciousness. Our bodily experiences and sensations, integrated in the brainstem, contribute to the rich tapestry of our subjective world.
                  Even though, Solms might be wrong about the exact source of consciousness, these theories (and those of Damasio and Seth/Friston) are strike three against humanity, after Galileo and Darwin.
