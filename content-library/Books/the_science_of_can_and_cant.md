# The Science of Can and Can't: A Physicist's Journey Through the Land of Counterfactuals

## Overview

In "The Science of Can and Can't," physicist Chiara Marletto proposes a radical new way to look at the universe: through the lens of counterfactuals.

## Key Concepts

Counterfactuals are essentially statements about what's possible or impossible for a system. Marletto argues that these properties, traditionally neglected by science, hold immense potential for unlocking new knowledge.
                  
                  Here's a glimpse into the book's ideas:
                      
 (1) Rethinking the Laws of Physics: Instead of just focusing on what is happening (dynamical laws), Marletto suggests incorporating what could happen (counterfactuals) into the fundamental framework of physics.
                      
 (2) Information Through Possibility: The book explores how information itself can be defined by counterfactuals. For example, a light switch being "on" implies the counterfactual possibility of it being switched "off." This reframes our understanding of information as the ability for a system to exist in different states.
                      
 (3) Applications Beyond Physics: Marletto suggests that the science of can and can't isn't limited to physics. It could revolutionize fields like computer science, leading to the development of more powerful processors and even influencing the design of artificial intelligence.

                  "The Science of Can and Can't" challenges our traditional way of thinking about science. It's a thought-provoking read for anyone curious about the universe's potential and the tools we might use to unlock its secrets.
