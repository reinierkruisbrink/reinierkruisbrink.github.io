 More Than Just War:  While war stories are woven in, The Odyssey explores themes of family, loyalty, hospitality (both offered and challenged), and the longing for home. The story also features strong female characters like Penelope, Odysseus's faithful wife, and Telemachus, his son who embarks on his own quest to find his father.
