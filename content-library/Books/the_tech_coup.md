# De Tech Coup: How to Save Democracy from Silicon Valley

## Overview

In "De Tech Coup," Marietje Schaake, a former Member of European Parliament and current Stanford policy expert, critically examines the increasing power and influence of major tech companies and how their largely unregulated dominance poses significant risks to democracy, privacy, and societal well-being.

## Key Concepts
### Power, Promise, and Risk

- **Concentration of Influence**: Tech firms wield economic, informational, and infrastructural power that can outstrip governmental oversight.
  - **Consequence**: Shaping public discourse, privacy norms, and market structures without democratic accountability.

### Promises versus Realities

- **Initial Promise**: Openness, decentralization, and rapid innovation expanded access and capabilities.
- **Reality Check**: Centralization of knowledge, platform incentives that reward engagement over civic goods, and surveillance-enabled business models.

### Regulation and Governance

- **Need for Rules**: Calls for rigorous standards, independent oversight, and international coordination to align technology with public interest.
  - **Approaches**: Data governance, antitrust measures, transparency mandates, and safety testing frameworks.

Schaake frames these dynamics as a civic challenge: preserve the benefits of technology while designing institutions and rules that prevent unchecked corporate dominance.
