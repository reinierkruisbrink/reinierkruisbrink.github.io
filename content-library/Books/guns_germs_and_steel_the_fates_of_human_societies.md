# Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies

## Overview

In Jared Diamond's thought-provoking book, "Guns, Germs, and Steel," he tackles a big question: Why did some societies develop complex technologies and empires while others remained hunter-gatherers? Diamond argues that the answer lies not in racial superiority, but in geographical advantages.

## Key Concepts
### Geographic and Environmental Determinism

- **Available Domesticates**: Regions with a diversity of easily domesticable plants and animals (e.g., in Eurasia) could adopt agriculture earlier and more stably.

### Biological Advantages and Pathogens

- **Disease Ecology**: Animal domestication and dense settlements enabled zoonoses that later acted as biological weapons during contacts between societies.

### Diffusion and Axis Effects

- **East–West Axis & Diffusion**: Continental orientations and similar climates facilitated the spread of crops, livestock, and technologies across similar latitudes.

Diamond argues these environmental and ecological differences — not inherent human differences — produced cascading advantages (food surplus, population density, technology, and immunity) that shaped historical inequalities.
