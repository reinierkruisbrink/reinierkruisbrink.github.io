# Geopedia

## Overview

Geopedia by Marcia Bjornerud is a fascinating account on the geological terms and concepts that shape our understanding of the Earth. It's a captivating journey through the lexicon of geology, from ancient Greek words to modern scientific terms.

## Key Concepts
### Dating the Earth

- **Isotope Geochronology**: Radioactive decay (e.g., uranium–lead in zircon) provides absolute dating tools for rocks and minerals.

### Tectonics and Surface Processes

- **Plate Tectonics**: Mechanisms of crustal movement that form mountains, generate earthquakes, and shape long-term surface evolution.

### Minerals as Records

- **Mineral Archives**: Durable minerals like zircon preserve chemical and textural clues about early Earth conditions and crustal processes.

Bjornerud frames geological vocabulary as a key to reading Earth’s history encoded in rocks and minerals.
