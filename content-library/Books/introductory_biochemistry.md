### Metabolism and Energy

- **Core Pathways**: Glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation as central energy-harvesting routes.
- **Enzymes**: Catalysis, regulation, and kinetics underpin metabolic control.

### Information and Signalling

- **Genetic Material & Signalling**: DNA/RNA structure and pathways for intracellular communication and regulation.

The book provides a concise foundation in biochemical principles for students and curious readers.
