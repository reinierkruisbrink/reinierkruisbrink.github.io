# Transformer: The Deep Chemistry of Life and Death

## Overview

In "Transformer: The Deep Chemistry of Life and Death," Nick Lane challenges traditional views on life by placing the spotlight on a fundamental biochemical process: the Krebs cycle / citric acid cycle.

## Key Concepts

The book argues that a central role in life's origin and function belongs to the Krebs cycle, a series of chemical reactions that can both break down molecules for energy and build them up for growth. 
                  Lane proposes that:
                      
 (1) Life's Origin at Deep-Sea Vents: The book suggests that early life forms might have emerged near deep-sea hydrothermal vents where the right chemical gradients existed to drive the Krebs cycle in reverse, building organic molecules. This theory posits us as literal children of the planet as life mimics the battery-like processes of the Earth's crust on our cell membranes.
                      
 (2) Metabolism Takes Center Stage: Understanding life revolves more around how cells manage energy and transform molecules than just genetic information.
                      
 (3) Krebs Cycle And Genes: The ability to harness energy through the Krebs cycle may have existed before the complex machinery of genes and proteins came into play. Moreover, the Krebs cycle's intermediates and mitochondrial DNA can have many complex effects on nuclear gene expression.
                      
 (4) Cancer and Aging: Lane proposes that the differences between healthy and cancerous cells lie partly in their metabolic efficiency and the signals metabolic intermediates release, with cancer cells prioritizing rapid growth over efficient energy use, and ageing cells being in an epigenetic setting that corresponds to low metabolic turnover.

                  Overall, "Transformer" offers an interesting and fresh perspective on life, emphasizing the primacy of metabolism and the Krebs cycle in shaping the living world from its origins to the complexities of health and disease.
