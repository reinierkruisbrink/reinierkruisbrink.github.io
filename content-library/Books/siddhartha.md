# Siddhartha

## Overview

Siddhartha by Herman Hesse (I read it in German) is a timeless novel on the spiritual journey of self-discovery and enlightenment. Set in ancient India, the book is heavily inspired by Buddhist and Hindu philosophies.

## Key Concepts

The story follows Siddhartha, a young Brahmin who is dissatisfied with the teachings of his upbringing. Yearning for a deeper understanding of life, he leaves his home and embarks on a quest for spiritual enlightenment. Along the way, Siddhartha explores different paths, including asceticism with the Samanas, learning from the Buddha Gotama, and indulging in worldly pleasures under the tutelage of the courtesan Kamala and the merchant Kamaswami.
                  
 Despite his experiences, Siddhartha finds that true wisdom cannot be taught or attained through external means. His journey comes full circle when he meets the ferryman Vasudeva, who teaches him to listen to the river—a symbol of the unity and timelessness of all existence. By embracing life in its totality, Siddhartha attains the enlightenment he sought, realizing that wisdom is found in the harmony of opposites and the interconnectedness of all things.

 The book, ironically, conveys the difference between felt experience and learned wisdom as opposed to relying on external authorities or dogmas or teachings to reach enlightenment. Obviously, it does not provide a roadmap to enlightenment, but it does provide a beautiful story that can inspire and provoke thought.
