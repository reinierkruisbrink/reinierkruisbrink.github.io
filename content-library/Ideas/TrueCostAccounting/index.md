# True Cost Accounting (TCA)

## The Challenge

Markets are extraordinary optimizers—but only of what they can measure. When a €2 chocolate bar is priced, it reflects supply chains, labor, and margins. What it doesn't reflect: child labor harvesting cocoa, deforestation clearing land, or health burdens from excessive sugar. These "externalities" aren't hidden by malice—they're invisible because our accounting systems weren't designed to see them.

The result is predictable: if environmental degradation, labor exploitation, and public health harm are "free," profit-seeking firms will rationally choose them. **This isn't a moral failing—it's a systems design flaw.**

## The Solution: Complete the Price Signal

True Cost Accounting proposes to complete the price signal through four innovations:

### 1. Multi-Dimensional Cost Vector

Transform cost from a single number into a structured object: $C=[C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4]$

- $C_1$: Market price (unchanged)
- $C_2$: Social externality (labor, rights, safety)
- $C_3$: Environmental externality (climate, water, biodiversity, pollution)
  - [[Books/clearing_the_air|"Clearing the Air"]]
  - [[Books/the_last_drop|"The Last Drop"]]
- $C_4$: Consumer/public health externality (diet, processing, exposure)
  - [[Books/ultra_processed_people|"Ultra Processed People"]]

### 2. Weighted Norm (Strong Sustainability)

Aggregate externalities using $N_{ext}(C)=\sqrt{w_2C_2^2+w_3C_3^2+w_4C_4^2}$ to prevent catastrophic harms from being offset. You can't balance out forced labor with carbon credits.

### 3. Unknown Penalty

Missing supply-chain data receives a conservative high-impact estimate (95th percentile). This makes transparency valuable and opacity expensive—inverting the current incentive where hiding information is advantageous.

### 4. VAT-Like Propagation

Apply an externality tax at each supply chain stage with input credits. Each firm pays only on externalities they add, creating incentives from farm to fork. Partially replace regressive VAT/BTW to improve equity.

## What This Enables

**Markets work properly** when prices tell the truth. Profit-seeking naturally selects sustainable practices because unsustainable ones become expensive.

**Supply chains become accountable.** Labor exploitation and environmental damage show up in costs—transparency becomes financially rational.

**Trade-offs become honest.** No more "carbon neutral" products hiding forced labor. The weighted norm prevents greenwashing through comprehensive accounting.

**Innovation gets directed** toward real solutions—clean energy, regenerative agriculture, safer labor—as competitive advantages rather than cost centers.

**Policy becomes coherent.** Replace patchwork regulations with unified framework. Disagreements move to auditable parameters, not vague sustainability claims.

**Equity improves.** Essential goods become relatively cheaper, high-externality goods pay their share, revenue funds support for vulnerable populations.

## Is This Realistic?

Yes. The technical infrastructure exists (databases, IoT traceability), the economic logic is proven (Pigouvian taxation works), and political appetite is growing (climate commitments, supply chain laws, ESG pressure). What's needed is integration: connecting the pieces into a coherent system.

This proposal doesn't require new ethics or different human nature. It simply requires that the price system tell the truth, so self-interest and profit-seeking are aligned with collective well-being. **Markets are powerful engines. Let's give them the right fuel.**
