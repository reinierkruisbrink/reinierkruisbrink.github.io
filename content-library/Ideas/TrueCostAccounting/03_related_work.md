# Related Work: Strengths and Gaps

This page positions TCA relative to existing approaches for measuring and internalizing externalities. The aim is to be precise about what each approach contributes, where gaps remain, and how TCA extends the landscape.

## True Price Foundation (TPF) / Impact Institute / GID

### Strengths
- **Practical methodologies** to translate impacts into € using restoration/remediation logic
- **Factor mindset** that is implementable: impact indicators → monetization factors
- **Concrete values**: Provides specific monetization factors (e.g., €0.312/kg CO₂e, €129,000/DALY)
- **Multi-dimensional thinking**: Addresses social, environmental, and health impacts
- **Restoration logic**: Uses cost-to-restore rather than arbitrary valuations

### How TCA Uses TPF
- TPF-style factors are the backbone for defining $C_2..C_4$
- Monetization factors provide the translation from physical indicators to €
- Restoration/remediation logic ensures conservative, defensible valuations
- Social cost categories (living wage gap, child labor, OHS) directly inform $C_2$

### Gaps That TCA Addresses
1. **No aggregation mechanism**: TPF typically sums impacts, allowing offsetting
   - *TCA solution*: Weighted norm prevents catastrophic harms from being averaged away
2. **Weak transparency enforcement**: Missing data often treated as zero
   - *TCA solution*: Unknown penalty makes opacity expensive
3. **Limited policy integration**: Primarily information/labeling focus
   - *TCA solution*: VAT-like intermediate taxing creates supply-chain incentives
4. **Consumer health underweighted**: Strong on worker health (OHS), weaker on consumer/diet impacts
   - *TCA solution*: Explicit $C_4$ component using Nutri-Score/NOVA proxies

## Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)

### Strengths
- **Rigorous accounting** of environmental pressures across full lifecycle
- **Methodological standards**: Scope definition, functional units, boundary conditions
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Multiple impact categories (climate, water, eutrophication, etc.)
- **Peer-reviewed methods**: ISO standards, established databases

### How TCA Relates
- **LCA is a supplier**: Provides indicators for $C_3$ and some health exposure components
- **Not competing**: TCA is a downstream decision/tax layer that needs LCA-like inputs
- **Functional unit alignment**: Both use per-unit analysis (kg, meal, service)

### Gaps That TCA Addresses
1. **Missing data handling**: LCA often excludes what cannot be measured
   - *TCA solution*: Unknown penalty provides conservative defaults rather than treating missingness as neutral
2. **No economic mechanism**: LCA informs but doesn't directly create market incentives
   - *TCA solution*: Tax mechanism translates LCA findings into financial signals
3. **Limited social integration**: LCA historically weak on labor/social dimensions
   - *TCA solution*: Equal treatment of social ($C_2$) and environmental ($C_3$) dimensions

## ESG Reporting (Environmental, Social, Governance)

### Strengths
- **Disclosure pressure** on firms to report non-financial impacts
- **Standardized categories** (SASB, GRI, TCFD frameworks)
- **Investor relevance**: Growing integration into financial decision-making
- **Narrative comparability**: Common reporting structure across firms

### Gaps That TCA Addresses
1. **Not transaction-linked**: ESG scores rarely connect to specific products/services
   - *TCA solution*: Product/service-level cost objects with direct tax linkage
2. **Weak immediate incentives**: Disclosure doesn't directly affect product economics
   - *TCA solution*: Externality tax creates immediate financial consequences
3. **Gaming vulnerability**: Scores can be manipulated through selective disclosure
   - *TCA solution*: Unknown penalty punishes opacity; VAT-like mechanism requires verification
4. **Hard to compare across sectors**: Different materiality for different industries
   - *TCA solution*: Unified € metric enables cross-sector comparison

### How ESG and TCA Can Complement
- ESG disclosures provide input data for calculating TCA components
- TCA mechanism makes ESG disclosures economically meaningful
- Firms already collecting ESG data can translate to TCA with additional monetization layer

## Consumer Labels (Nutri-Score, Eco-Score, etc.)

### Strengths
- **Interpretability**: Simple visual signals (A-E, traffic lights)
- **Behavioral nudges**: Demonstrated impact on purchasing decisions
- **Category-specific**: Optimized for context (nutrition for food, energy for appliances)
- **Consumer-facing**: Accessible, no technical expertise required

### Gaps That TCA Addresses
1. **No supply-chain incentives**: Labels inform consumers but don't change upstream behavior
   - *TCA solution*: Intermediate taxing propagates incentives to all supply-chain actors
2. **Single-dimension focus**: Each label typically addresses one issue (nutrition OR environment)
   - *TCA solution*: Multi-dimensional vector integrates multiple concerns
3. **No financial mechanism**: Labels alone don't change relative prices
   - *TCA solution*: Tax mechanism makes label information actionable in price signals

### How TCA Uses Labels
- Nutri-Score and NOVA provide indicators for $C_4$ (consumer health)
- Eco-Score methodologies inform $C_3$ (environmental) indicator selection
- TCA provides the "hard signal" (tax) behind the "soft signal" (label)
- Can display TCA components using label-like visual language (4-color traffic light)

## Carbon Taxes / Cap-and-Trade

### Strengths
- **Proven policy mechanism**: Successful implementations in multiple jurisdictions
- **Market-based**: Uses price signals to drive behavior change
- **Revenue generation**: Can fund clean energy transitions or rebates
- **Simplicity**: Single dimension is easy to administer and audit

### Gaps That TCA Addresses
1. **Single-dimension**: Only addresses climate, allows "carbon tunnel vision"
   - *TCA solution*: Multi-dimensional vector prevents solving one problem while creating others
2. **Point-of-emission focus**: Often taxed at extraction or large emitters, not products
   - *TCA solution*: Product-level accounting with supply-chain propagation
3. **Offsetting concerns**: Can buy credits while maintaining harmful practices
   - *TCA solution*: Norm structure prevents offsetting catastrophic harms in non-climate dimensions

### How TCA Differs
- **Generalizes the concept**: Carbon tax logic applied to multiple externality families
- **VAT-like propagation**: Throughout supply chain, not just at extraction/production
- **Prevents substitution**: Can't have great climate but terrible labor and call it "sustainable"

## True Cost Accounting (Academic Literature)

### Strengths
- **Theoretical foundation**: Links to environmental economics, welfare economics
- **Critiques of GDP**: Documents failures of GDP as welfare measure
- **Sustainability frameworks**: Strong vs. weak sustainability debates
- **Natural capital accounting**: Methods to value ecosystem services

### Gaps That TCA Addresses
1. **Implementation deficit**: Strong theory, weak policy mechanisms
   - *TCA solution*: Specific tax design (VAT-like) with concrete implementation path
2. **Data idealism**: Often assumes perfect information
   - *TCA solution*: Unknown penalty explicitly handles incomplete data
3. **Aggregation debates**: How to combine incommensurable values
   - *TCA solution*: Norm structure provides mathematical commitment to non-substitutability

## Food Transparency Initiatives (Open Food Facts, etc.)

### Strengths
- **Crowdsourced data**: Large-scale product databases (>2.8M products)
- **Open access**: Freely available for research and applications
- **Standardized fields**: Nutri-Score, NOVA, ingredients, origins
- **Real-time updates**: Living database with continuous contributions

### Gaps That TCA Addresses
1. **Data, not mechanisms**: Provides information but no economic incentives
   - *TCA solution*: Uses Open Food Facts data as input to tax calculation
2. **Voluntary disclosure**: Incomplete for many products/supply chains
   - *TCA solution*: Unknown penalty incentivizes firms to ensure data completeness

### How TCA Uses These Initiatives
- Primary data source for $C_4$ indicators (Nutri-Score, NOVA)
- Ingredient data for processing-level assessment
- Can feed back TCA results to enhance transparency platforms

## Summary: What Is Distinctive in TCA

| Dimension | Existing Approaches | TCA Innovation |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Object** | Often single-issue or narrative | Multi-dimensional vector $C=[C_1,C_2,C_3,C_4]$ in €/unit |
| **Aggregation** | Linear sums (offsetting allowed) | Norm over externalities $N_{ext}(C)$ (strong sustainability) |
| **Transparency** | Voluntary or uneven enforcement | Unknown penalty for missing/unverified data |
| **Policy** | Point-of-sale or extraction-point | VAT-like intermediate externality taxing |
| **Equity** | Often regressive (carbon taxes) | Partial VAT replacement with revenue recycling |
| **Supply Chain** | Downstream focus (labels, consumer) | Propagates incentives to all tiers |
| **Comparability** | Hard across sectors (ESG) | Unified € metric enables cross-sector comparison |
| **Gaming Resistance** | Vulnerable (cherry-picking, offsets) | Norm + unknown penalty + audit requirements |

## Synergies and Integration Opportunities

TCA is not designed to replace existing approaches but to **integrate and operationalize** them:

1. **Use TPF factors** for monetization while adding norm-based aggregation
2. **Consume LCA data** for environmental indicators with unknown penalty for gaps
3. **Translate ESG disclosures** into product-level cost components
4. **Provide mechanism behind labels**: Make Nutri-Score/Eco-Score financially meaningful
5. **Generalize carbon pricing**: Extend proven mechanism to multiple dimensions
6. **Enable academic frameworks**: Bridge theory-practice gap with concrete implementation

## What TCA Enables That Others Don't

- **Strong sustainability enforcement**: Mathematical commitment prevents offsetting catastrophic harms
- **Supply-chain propagation**: Every actor faces direct financial incentive to reduce externalities
- **Opacity is expensive**: Transparency becomes economically rational, not just ethical
- **Cross-sector comparability**: €-denominated vector enables apples-to-oranges comparison
- **Equity design**: Can be progressive while existing carbon taxes are often regressive
- **Auditable disagreements**: Debates move to explicit parameters (weights, factors, quantiles) rather than vibes
