# Weights, Legitimacy, and Gaming Resistance

The weights $w_i$ are where the math becomes political. This page is about making that explicit and designing for legitimacy.

## What weights do

- determine trade-offs *within the norm*
- create predictable incentives and predictable lobbying targets

## Legitimacy questions (what to write later)

- How are weights set (democratic process, expert panels, or treaty)?
- At what jurisdiction (national, EU, global)?
- How often can weights change?
- Should there be bounds (e.g., each $w_i \in [0.2,0.3]$) to prevent collapse back to $w_1=1$?

## Anti-gaming design

- publish factor registries and dataset versions
- require traceability claims to be auditable
- keep unknown penalty rules deterministic and public
- define “safe harbors” (if you provide specific verified data, you get lower cost)

## Narrative connection

This is the bridge between:

- the technical model ($C$ and $N(C)$)
- the tax policy layer (VAT-like intermediate externality tax)
- the social contract (fairness and regressivity mitigation)
