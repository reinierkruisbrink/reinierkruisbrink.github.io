# Background: Smith, Friedman, Pigou

This page gives the intellectual backdrop for True Cost Accounting (TCA). It’s not a literature review; it’s a compact set of “why this idea is a natural next step” arguments.

## Adam Smith: the price signal works when prices are complete

Smith’s core contribution is not “greed is good”; it’s that decentralized coordination can work when the **price signal** compresses relevant information.

TCA’s stance:

- markets are powerful optimizers
- but the signal is incomplete when costs can be pushed outside the transaction
- therefore, the fix is not to abandon the signal, but to **complete it**

In this project, completion means adding monetised social/environmental/health components to a Multi-Dimensional accounting object (see [[Ideas/TrueCostAccounting/vector_components_tpf|Vector components]]).

## Milton Friedman: profit maximization is a strong engine with a narrow objective

Friedman’s argument is powerful because it is operational: a single objective (profit) is easy to optimize and easy to audit.

TCA’s stance:

- profit maximization is not “wrong”; it is **underspecified**
- if firms maximize profit under incomplete prices, they rationally externalize costs
- the policy problem is therefore the objective’s *input data*: the price system

If you change the price system, you change what profit-seeking selects for.

## Arthur Pigou: taxes internalize externalities, but usually one-by-one

Pigou formalized the logic of correcting market failures by taxing negative externalities.

TCA generalizes Pigou in two ways:

1. **Multi-Dimensional accounting**: instead of one externality at a time, represent the main externality families simultaneously.
2. **Propagation mechanics**: instead of only taxing at final sale, use a VAT-like mechanism with input credits so incentives apply throughout the supply chain.

See:

- [[Ideas/TrueCostAccounting/weighted_norm|Weighted norm]] (why a norm over externalities)
- [[Ideas/TrueCostAccounting/vat_replacement|VAT replacement + intermediate TrueCost tax]] (why VAT-like propagation matters)

## Why the norm matters (beyond Pigou)

Pigouvian taxes are often additive: tax = sum of priced harms.

This project uses an **externality norm** $N_{ext}(C)$ to encode a “strong sustainability” constraint: catastrophic harms should dominate the signal rather than being offset by excellence elsewhere.

See [[Ideas/TrueCostAccounting/weighted_norm|Weighted norm]].
